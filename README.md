# How to develop

1. Run with tests on to make sure your changes don't break anything: `npm run test`

### `$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`

### `$ source ~/.bash_profile`

### `$ source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh`

### `$ nvm install v16.4.0`

 ```
$ [[ -s $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh ]] && . $HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh
$ nvm use v16.4.0
```

3. In the root of this directory (apteo/website) run:

### `$ npm install`

All the node packages will be installed. To start the app type:

### `$ npm start`
